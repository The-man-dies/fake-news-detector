# DDD Domain Summary - Fake News Detector

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Fake News Detector** is a fact-checking platform that enables collaborative verification of news and information through a structured workflow involving Citizens, Journalists, and Editorial Directors.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Bounded Context
- **Core Domain**: Fact-checking workflow and content verification
- **Supporting Domains**: User management, notifications, watcher applications

---

## 👥 Domain Actors (Aggregates)

### 1. Actor (Base Entity)
The central entity unifying all user types via the `role` field.

**Attributes:**
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`, `email`: Contact information
- `role`: CITIZEN | JOURNALIST | EDITORIAL_DIRECTOR
- `status`: ACTIVE | DISABLED | BANNED
- `citizenType`: REGULAR | WATCHER
- `engagementScore`: User activity metric

**Behaviors:**
- `isActive()`, `canLogin()`
- `incrementEngagementScore()`
- `markInboxAsRead()`

### 2. Citizen (extends Actor)
Regular users who submit reports and can become Watchers.

**Invariants:**
- Max 3 open reports simultaneously
- Must be WATCHER to submit evidence

**Behaviors:**
- `submitReport()`, `submitEvidence()`
- `applyForWatcher()`, `promoteToWatcher()`

### 3. Journalist (extends Actor)
Users who investigate reports and produce verifications.

**Invariants:**
- Max 1 active investigation at a time

**Behaviors:**
- `pickReport()`, `submitInvestigationDraft()`
- `submitForReview()`, `correctInvestigation()`

### 4. Director (extends Actor)
Editorial directors who validate and publish investigations.

**Behaviors:**
- `validateInvestigation()`, `rejectInvestigation()`
- `publishInvestigation()`, `markAsUnverifiable()`
- `manageUsers()`, `approveWatcherApplication()`

## 📦 Core Domain Entities

### Report
A user-submitted claim to be verified.

**Attributes:**
- `theme`, `title`, `content`
- `status`: OPEN | IN_PROGRESS | RESOLVED
- `citizenId`: Submitter reference

**Invariants:**
- Can only be picked if status is OPEN
- Citizen must have available report slots

### Investigation
The fact-checking process for a Report.

**Attributes:**
- `mediaCategory`: Category of media being checked
- `draftVerdict`: TRUE | FALSE | UNVERIFIABLE
- `investigationNotes`: Detailed analysis
- `attemptCount`: Number of correction cycles
- `status`: DRAFT | PENDING_REVIEW | PUBLISHED

**Lifecycle:**
1. DRAFT → Journalist works on investigation
2. PENDING_REVIEW → Submitted for Director validation
3. PUBLISHED → Approved and public

### Evidence
Supporting documentation submitted by Watchers.

**Attributes:**
- `content`, `title`
- `investigationId`: Linked investigation
- `watcherId`: Submitter (must be WATCHER type)

### Publication
Final published result of an investigation.

**Attributes:**
- `finalVerdict`: TRUE | FALSE | UNVERIFIABLE
- `publishedAt`: Publication timestamp
- `isCorrection`: Whether this corrects a previous publication
- `approvedById`: Validating Director

## 🔗 Domain Relationships

```
Citizen 1--* Report (submits)
Report 1--0..1 Investigation (becomes)
Journalist 1--* Investigation (conducts)
Investigation 1--* Evidence (contains)
Evidence *--1 Citizen/Watcher (submitted by)
Investigation 1--0..1 Publication (produces)
Publication 1--* Notification (generates)
Director 1--* InboxSubject (manages)
Citizen 1--0..1 WatcherApplication (applies for)
```

## ⚠️ Critical Business Rules (Invariants)

1. **Citizen Report Limit**: Max 3 open reports per citizen
2. **Journalist Investigation Limit**: Max 1 active investigation per journalist
3. **Evidence Submission**: Only WATCHER citizens can submit evidence
4. **Watcher Promotion**: Requires Director approval via WatcherApplication
5. **Investigation Publication**: Only Director can approve and publish
6. **Correction Chain**: Publications can be corrected with `isCorrection` flag

## 🔍 Anti-Patterns to Detect

1. **Anemic Domain Model**: Entities with only getters/setters, no business logic
2. **God Services**: Application services with too many responsibilities
3. **Repository Leakage**: Domain logic in repositories
4. **Missing Invariants**: Business rules not enforced in domain layer
5. **Wrong Layer Access**: Infrastructure directly accessed from domain
